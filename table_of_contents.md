Introduction
-----------------

* Contributing to faculty development research in engineering education
 * Missed opportunities for faculty development
 * Current SOTL and faculty development research in engineering education
* Speaking Curriculum: framing faculty development as linguistic fluency
 * Engineering faculty don't "speak" pedagogy
 * One example of a thing we could use: Cognitive Apprenticeship framework (but it might fall apart)
 * Limited bridging between high-level engineering curricular theory theory and ground-level practice
* What we know about learning
 * Knowledge is situated and enculturated (epistemology)
 * Discourse is an important part of belonging to a CoP
 * Apprentices progress from specific embedded activities to general cultural principles
 * Does not match the situation of engineering faculty
* The situation of engineering faculty: an environment not conducive to curricular "fluency"
 * New faculty are isloated and not prepared for teaching
 * We socialize faculty into research, but not teaching
 * There's not really a cohesive CoP for engineering teaching
* Prior attempts to change this situation
 * [Qualities of existing faculty development initiatives] with examples
 * Measures of validity: who do they try to reach, and in what format?
 * Research-to-practice does not happen with papers
 * Limited evidence of long-term change
* We shouldn't be surprised by this lack of change, given what we know about change.
 * We resist change when we can't see ourselves in a changed future
 * We change our stories about ourselves before we change our visible behavior
 * Ontology - identity is performative
* How does teaching change in engineering actually happen?
 * Measures of Quality: does the research spark conversation? Does it get "used"?
 * Teaching practice changes happen because of accidental bumps into people, not deliberate searches
* Research question: How do engineering and technology faculty make sense of their teaching identities through public storytelling centered on curricular revision?
* Who cares? Potential audiences (table or list)

My narrators and me: positionality and participants
---------------------------

* This project studies individual engineering and technology faculty members.
 * Faculty are my unit of analysis
 * [Description of participants] as a unit of study
 * Description of schools as context of research
* My participants and I have an existing relationship dynamic.
 * participating faculty are "narrators" (not "participants" or "subjects")
 * I'm a student and they're profs (power dynamic)
 * I like my narrators
 * Existing relationships with narrators
* Why a poststructural approach
 * I take a poststructural approach of interruption and discomfort
 * My themes are emergent because I want to deliberately coconstruct them and point out we are socially constructing them
* The implications of a poststructural stance on the portrayal of positionality
 * I'm biased
 * I'm opinionated on these topics of discusion
 * I will try to shut up and work with/elicit narrator voices
 * Goal is to get participants to claim agency and recognize it in others

Cognitive apprenticeship as a priori scaffolding
-----------------------

* Cognitive Apprenticeship is my theoretical starting point
 * CogApp is my a priori theory
 * CogApp is a temporary scaffolding; I'm using it until something better comes along, and expect to end up with something different
 * CogApp is like the "novice" (Dreyfuss) Mad Libs version; I'm going for haiku
 * Looking for opportunities to make CogApp fall apart (very poststructural of me)
 * CogApp makes thinking visible in a community in action
* Cognitive Apprenticeship codes
 * [list of CogApp codes]
 * CogApp mentors model, scaffold, coach, & fade - metacognition support
 * Mentors create ZPDs (for things like metacognition)
* Reflection is a part of CogApp
 * but CogApp does not address identity (critique of framework)
 * Reflective practice (which is related to metacognition) is an established thing with methods & benefits documented
 * I'm asking my narrators to reflect on their experiences on curric rev teams
 * We benefit from being conscious of things as we do them
 * This reflective practice bridges past actions to present consciousness and future plans
* Relationship between Identity development and CogApp
 * Identity development is the outcome of CogApp - apprentices make themselves into masters
 * Look, this addresses my research question
 * I want to make CogApp happen between my narrators

Narrative analysis as methodology
------------------------

* The methodological choice of narrative analysis comes from discourse ideas within Cognitive Apprenticeship
 * I am using narrative analysis
 * sensemaking is storytelling
 * public storytelling on curricular revision is engaging in a cognitive apprenticeship
 * Creates a disciplinary commons
 * discourse participation is an important CogApp skill
* Individual narratives and (performed) identities are also communal in nature
 * NarAn is a community engagement
 * We write our stories together, we perform them to each other, we interpret them for each other, we disagree (poststructural)
 * We naturally comment on each others' stories
 * NarAn helps individual reflection in/on community roles
 * Our autobiographical storytelling interacts with our identity formation
 * We make sense of our (and others') teaching identities together
* It's within this sort of community environment/engagement that individual identities develop
 * Learners situate their own development within many living other examples of mastery-in-progress (older apprenticeships and journeymen on the open shop floor)
 * Increased ability to make sense of context is a hallmark of mastery

The role of Transparency in this projct
---------------------

* I'm taking a radically transparent approach to my narrative analysis to provide the following affordances
 * I do my NarAn in a structured and transparent way
 * Transparency allows back-tracing (validity!)
* This lets more people have access
 * Lurking is key for underrepresented groups
 * Legitimizing peripheral participation is key to draw in new participants
* This dissertation is an experiment with a new research method
 * RTR is a new method in qualitative research
 * It's been piloted
 * This dissertation is the next step and intended to provide a full example of its usage in a research project
 * This may be a bigger contribution than the actual study outcomes, but we'll see
 * I am using it right now, not studying it; don't get distracted
 * Maybe I'll study it later
