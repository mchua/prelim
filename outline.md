Intro

Missed opportunities for faculty development
FacDev/SOTL is a thing; it's still sparse in Engr Edu

Engineering faculty don't speak "pedagogy" language
We discuss curricular reform at either super-high theoretical levels or super-specific practitioner levels; there's not much in the middle linking theory to practice

New faculty are isloated and not prepared for teaching
We socialize faculty into research, but not teaching
There's not really a cohesive CoP for engineering teaching

Knowledge is situated and enculturated
Apprentices progress from specific embedded activities to general cultural principles

Validity: does it reach people? (Who? What format?)
Research-to-practice does not happen with papers

We resist change when we can't see ourselves in a changed future
We change our stories about ourselves before we change our visible behavior

Quality: does the research spark conversation? Does it get "used"?
Teaching practice changes happen because of accidental bumps into people, not deliberate searches. This is how teaching change really happens.

RQ: How do engineering and technology faculty make sense of their teaching identities through public storytelling centered on curricular revision?

My narrators and me: positionality and participants
====================================================

Faculty are my unit of analysis
[Description of participants] as a unit of study

I'm a student and they're profs (power dynamic)
I like my narrators
Existing relationships with narrators

I take a poststructural approach of interruption and discomfort
My themes are emergent because I want to deliberately coconstruct them and point out we are socially constructing them

I'm biased
I'm opinionated on these topics of discusion

I will try to shut up and work with/elicit narrator voices
Get participants to claim agency and recognize it in others

Cognitive apprenticeship as a priori scaffolding
=================================================

CogApp is a priori
CogApp is a temporary scaffolding
CogApp makes thinking visible in a community in action

[list of CogApp codes]
CogApp mentors model, scaffold, coach, & fade - metacognition support
Mentors create ZPDs (for things like metacognition)

Reflective practice (which is related to metacognition) is an established thing with methods & benefits documented
We benefit from being conscious of things as we do them

Identity development is the outcome of CogApp - apprentices make themselves into masters
I want to make CogApp happen between my narrators

Narrative analysis as methodology
==================================

I am using narrative analysis
sensemaking is storytelling
public storytelling on curricular revision is engaging in a cognitive apprenticeship

NarAn is a community engagement
We naturally comment on each others' stories
NarAn helps individual reflection in/on community roles
Our autobiographical storytelling interacts with our identity formation
We make sense of our (and others') teaching identities together
Learners situate their own development within many living other examples of mastery-in-progress (older apprenticeships and journeymen on the open shop floor)
Increased ability to make sense of context is a hallmark of mastery

Transparency
=============

I do my NarAn in a structured and transparent way
Transparency allows back-tracing (validity!)

Lurking is key for underrepresented groups
Legitimizing peripheral participation is key

RTR is a new method, I am using it right now (not studying it)
