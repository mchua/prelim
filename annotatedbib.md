MULTIVOCALITY

The Association of American Colleges and Universities reminds us that diversity needs to be encountered "affectively as well as intellectually." (1995, p. 22)

WHAT SORT OF OBJECTIVITY DOES THIS PROJECT HAVE? WHAT TYPE OF KNOWLEDGE DOES IT PRODUCE?

This project creates "socially situated knowledge" (50), which is a puzzlement. "Socially situated" things are supposed to be opinions, because "knowledge" transcends local/personal agendas, ties, histories, etc. (50). (CONNECT TO PORTER)

GETTING DIFFERENT, "NOISIER" PERSPECTIVES IS A GOAL OF THIS METHOD; IT'S NOT NOISE, IT'S SIGNAL POINTING OUT OUR BLIND SPOTS.

Standpoint theory's viewpoint is that marginalized peoples see things differently -- they see more things more broadly -- than the privileged, who have a more limited view. And wouldn't a "bigger view" lead to stronger objectivity than one that excludes a large chunk of the world? (54-55) And wouldn't exposing both the reading and the writing of our research work lead to the possibility of stronger objectivity -- peer review and so forth, but peer review not just from us, but from our subjects, from the people they work with, from anyone who cares to participate in the world? Need to be careful that we keep the signal/noise ratio here, but also be careful how we determine what is signal, what is noise.

But "scientific method provides no rules, procedures, or techniques for even identifying, let alone eliminating, social concerns and interests that are shared by all (or virtually all) of the observers, nor does it encourage seeking out observers whose social beliefs vary in order to increase the effectiveness of the scientific method." (57) So we take our assumptions into the research and don't realize them, the same way medical research was done mostly on men and engineering research is mostly done on white men and we can't necessarily apply it to the whole of all humanity. The "noise" of this project will, at times, be signal -- signal pointing out to us that we are sliding into comfortable assumptions, that there is actually something here we need to stop and unpack. It is a slower process of teaching and unpacking and so forth, but I think it will reach deeper, involve more.

N^: This reminds me of a few things: the argument for diversity in design teams and examples like how cars are designed to be crash-safe for male and not female bodies, Barad's agential realism "cuts" between obesrver and observed and how we tend to draw the boundaries of "observer" around a small privileged minority of the human population, an article on how psych literature done on Americans has been generalized as "universal" whereas American thinking is actually the oddball compared to global societies (but we're the majority of those who "research" like this), the literature on sampling for qualitative reseach and how we could apply the same logic not just to "subjects" but to "researchers" as well, and Barad again in going "what's the difference between subject/researcher? we chose agential cuts that made it so." (BARAD)

Q 61: (rearranged by Mel) [Standpoint theorists are not relativists; even] if there is no single standard for deciding between competing knowledge claims, [there are] some social situations [that] are scientifically better than others as places from which to start off knowledge projects. (61)

GETTING OTHERS INTO OUR WORLD REQUIRES THE HIGHLY POLITICAL ACTION OF GIVING THEM ACCESS INTO OUR CONTEXT

Scientists never observe nature apart from such traditions; even when they criticize some aspects of them they must assume others in order to carry on the criticism. They could not do science if they did not both borrow from and criticize these traditions. Their assumptions about what they see are always shaped by "conversations" they carry on with scientists of the past. (64) So to get non-ENE folks involved in our research -- including using our research -- we need to help them step into our traditions, our conversations, give them a sense of situating themselves in that place... without requiring too much time to get in deeply, but perhaps only a sense of absolute presence for a while, and honest giving. And we should treat that dialogue as LPP, as something real that they do to contribute to the field. Not the sort of authorship we do, perhaps -- but a sort of authorship nevertheless. (DREYFUSS)

N^: Lots of threads in here! Barad's agential realism "slicing" creates subject and object, and that slicing is shared between communities by Porter's "long-distance communications technology" of numbers/quantization (another sort of objectivity view) so that the same slice may be used by people who don't know and innately trust each other as individuals. Where does the standpoint theory come into this -- is it a call to include more people in that society? (Maybe, but this sounds too simple.) Is it a critique that such a society can never fully acknowledge the marginalized, that only communities and personal knowledge can? (I doubt it.) I am also reminded by the "conversations with scientists of the past" thing of Barad's thanks to Bohr in the preface to "Meeting the universe halfway." (CLEARLY NEED TO WEAVE IN BARAD)

P 72-74: We can't say that starting from marginalized lives gives us more value-neutral research, because there's no such thing as value-neutral research; the statement that starting from marginalized lives is more value-neutral is itself a statement of value (starting from the margins is more valuable). We can't detach the "strong method" (of starting from the margins) from "strong objectivity" (which questions subject/object separation and requires reflexivity).

N: Val Aurora's blog post on ball lightning, http://blog.valerieaurora.org/2013/05/10/ball-lightning-the-coolest-thing-youve-never-heard-of/, has some nice references to marginalization of the perspectives of marginalized people; meteors and ball lightning are both phenomena usually observed by peasants and so they were both discounted for a long time (whereas when a nobleperson discovered the same thing, it was suddenly real).

GIVING OTHERS ACCESS TO OUR CONTEXT REQUIRES US TO BE CONSCIOUS OF OUR OWN CONTEXT

Strong objectivity requires strong reflexivity, consciousness of all the decisions you're making about boundaries, etc. along the way. (69) I strive for this consciousness here. How? Forced public rearticulation of it to others who come from outside my research world.

---------------------------

PROFESSORS NEED TO EXPERIENCE SELF-AUTHORSHIP IN THEIR TEACHING DEVELOPMENT BEFORE THEY CAN TEACH SELF-AUTHORSHIP TO ENGINEERING STUDENTS

King and Baxter-Magolda's model of learning partnerships can only be taught by professors who have themselves experienced and internalized their three principles: (1) validate the capacity of learners as knowledge constructors, (2) situate learning in the learner's experience, and (3) define learning as mutually constructing meaning. (2004, xix)

Most written resources for faculty development do not apply these principles. Instead, they obscure the hermeneutic nature of their own text (BRUNER) with a readerly style (BARTHES) that treats the reader as a consumer of information rather than a co-constructor of meaning, and provide generalizable principles without urging the (now-passive) reader to put their learning to use in their environment.

THE USE OF STRICTLY CONTROLLED PROCESSES IN RESEARCH SERVES AS A REPLACEMENT OF PERSONAL TRUST RELATIONSHIPS WHEN WE ARE TRYING TO TRANSMIT KNOWLEDGE TO A LARGE, FAR-AWAY SCIENTIFIC SOCIETY.

Porter (1995) describes how bridging local communities of research into a global society of knowledge requires long-distance communication technologies. In order to scale, we've used mechanical objectivity to replace personal relationships. By adhering to strict scripts, formulae, and computations, we create a "highly disciplined discourse" that can "produce knowledge independent of the particular people who make it." (ix) "There should be no room for the biases of the researcher to corrupt the results." (7)

N^: Work this against the thoughts on "symbol" found in Cavallaro -- symbols are given meaning by their repeated use in different context, so if we share the same rules for the repeated use of (math) symbols, they will have the same meaning to us (for some value of "same").

N^: Work this against the personal trust relationships in the 1:1 interactions described by Sally & Borrego and fostered by in-person workshops and projects like the DCommons. 

THE MEDIUM WE USE FOR RESEARCH TRANSMISSION HEAVILY AFFECTS WHAT RESEARCH WE CAN TRANSMIT AND WHO CAN TRANSMIT AND RECEIVE IT; MY PROJECT'S USE OF RTR DELIBERATELY CHALLENGES OUR "DEFAULT SETTINGS"

How do we make knowledge more open, able-to-be-shared? Research depends heavily on the trust readers place in researchers to do solid, careful work towards the "truth." One practice researchers use to build this trust is the provision of replication instructions alongside their results, which supposedly makes all quality research "open" to "anyone." I disagree; the playing field for both researchers and research topics is uneven, the message heavily impacted by a medium that carries some things better than others, and carries it to some people better than others. Replication instructions are only useful to those who can understand them and have the equipment and time to work through them, and "acceptable" methods and instruments are ones that can be replicated over time and distance (Porter, 1995, p. 226-227). It's easy to see why qualitative research gets short shrift; it's less replicable, owing to the technical and ethical difficulties of transmitting thousands of pages of (often handwritten) notes detailing the intimate lives of other people.

This project experiments with the medium in order to see what happens with the message. How does our ability to expose our qualitative work online affect the type of qualitative work we think we can do? I am setting up a sandbox where these technical and ethical difficulties can be put aside. The data is fully transcribed and available online, and narrators have given their consent to having their stories told in public. It is a partial and temporary putting-aside. Internet access, English fluency, and leisure time are still required to interact with this research project. Pauses, blinks, and tone of voice are lost in the choice to provide only text transcripts and not audio or video recordings. I am ultimately the one who is hearing all these narratives firsthand; the questions that are asked are asked by me, and only the narrator and I witness the process of editing their story into a public transcript.

I try to close this gap of researcher privilege by limiting my analysis as much as possible to only draw on the "open" data of the project, but the gap still remains. This project not expose the private perfectly: as Bishop Untener put it, "We cannot do everything, and there is a sense of liberation in realizing that. This enables us to do something, and to do it very well. It may be incomplete, but it is a beginning, a step along the way." (Untener, 1979). Just because something is perfect does not mean it is useless. Through this project, I will expose what I can and acknowledge the limitations and fragmentation of what I do expose.
