MULTIVOCALITY

The Association of American Colleges and Universities reminds us that diversity needs to be encountered "affectively as well as intellectually." (1995, p. 22)

PROFESSORS NEED TO EXPERIENCE SELF-AUTHORSHIP IN THEIR TEACHING DEVELOPMENT BEFORE THEY CAN TEACH SELF-AUTHORSHIP TO ENGINEERING STUDENTS

King and Baxter-Magolda's model of learning partnerships can only be taught by professors who have themselves experienced and internalized their three principles: (1) validate the capacity of learners as knowledge constructors, (2) situate learning in the learner's experience, and (3) define learning as mutually constructing meaning. (2004, xix)

Most written resources for faculty development do not apply these principles. Instead, they obscure the hermeneutic nature of their own text (BRUNER) with a readerly style (BARTHES) that treats the reader as a consumer of information rather than a co-constructor of meaning, and provide generalizable principles without urging the (now-passive) reader to put their learning to use in their environment.

THE USE OF STRICTLY CONTROLLED PROCESSES IN RESEARCH SERVES AS A REPLACEMENT OF PERSONAL TRUST RELATIONSHIPS WHEN WE ARE TRYING TO TRANSMIT KNOWLEDGE TO A LARGE, FAR-AWAY SCIENTIFIC SOCIETY.

Porter (1995) describes how bridging local communities of research into a global society of knowledge requires long-distance communication technologies. In order to scale, we've used mechanical objectivity to replace personal relationships. By adhering to strict scripts, formulae, and computations, we create a "highly disciplined discourse" that can "produce knowledge independent of the particular people who make it." (ix) "There should be no room for the biases of the researcher to corrupt the results." (7)

N^: Work this against the thoughts on "symbol" found in Cavallaro -- symbols are given meaning by their repeated use in different context, so if we share the same rules for the repeated use of (math) symbols, they will have the same meaning to us (for some value of "same").

N^: Work this against the personal trust relationships in the 1:1 interactions described by Sally & Borrego and fostered by in-person workshops and projects like the DCommons. 

THE MEDIUM WE USE FOR RESEARCH TRANSMISSION HEAVILY AFFECTS WHAT RESEARCH WE CAN TRANSMIT AND WHO CAN TRANSMIT AND RECEIVE IT; MY PROJECT'S USE OF RTR DELIBERATELY CHALLENGES OUR "DEFAULT SETTINGS"

How do we make knowledge more open, able-to-be-shared? Research depends heavily on the trust readers place in researchers to do solid, careful work towards the "truth." One practice researchers use to build this trust is the provision of replication instructions alongside their results, which supposedly makes all quality research "open" to "anyone." I disagree; the playing field for both researchers and research topics is uneven, the message heavily impacted by a medium that carries some things better than others, and carries it to some people better than others. Replication instructions are only useful to those who can understand them and have the equipment and time to work through them, and "acceptable" methods and instruments are ones that can be replicated over time and distance (Porter, 1995, p. 226-227). It's easy to see why qualitative research gets short shrift; it's less replicable, owing to the technical and ethical difficulties of transmitting thousands of pages of (often handwritten) notes detailing the intimate lives of other people.

This project experiments with the medium in order to see what happens with the message. How does our ability to expose our qualitative work online affect the type of qualitative work we think we can do? I am setting up a sandbox where these technical and ethical difficulties can be put aside. The data is fully transcribed and available online, and narrators have given their consent to having their stories told in public. It is a partial and temporary putting-aside. Internet access, English fluency, and leisure time are still required to interact with this research project. Pauses, blinks, and tone of voice are lost in the choice to provide only text transcripts and not audio or video recordings. I am ultimately the one who is hearing all these narratives firsthand; the questions that are asked are asked by me, and only the narrator and I witness the process of editing their story into a public transcript.

I try to close this gap of researcher privilege by limiting my analysis as much as possible to only draw on the "open" data of the project, but the gap still remains. This project not expose the private perfectly: as Bishop Untener put it, "We cannot do everything, and there is a sense of liberation in realizing that. This enables us to do something, and to do it very well. It may be incomplete, but it is a beginning, a step along the way." (Untener, 1979). Just because something is perfect does not mean it is useless. Through this project, I will expose what I can and acknowledge the limitations and fragmentation of what I do expose.
